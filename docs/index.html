        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>
          hi! i'm known online as aloelucidity. i'm a game developer born in 2006 who likes to dabble in a variety of projects.<br>
          i'm mainly known for developing a faithful Godot port of Super Mario 63 as well as for my work in the SMB1 fan community, but i like to make original projects as well!<br>
          flash games had a big impact on me growing up, and that tends to show in my style. still, i hold myself to a pretty high standard, i'm always trying to improve :)
