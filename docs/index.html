        hi! i'm known online as aloelucidity. i'm a 19 year old game developer who likes to dabble in a variety of projects.<br>
        i'm mainly known for developing a faithful Godot port of Super Mario 63 as well as for my work in the SMB1 fan community, but i like to make original projects as well!<br>
        my style is inspired by flash games i played during my youth, but i'm always trying to learn and improve. i hold myself to a pretty high standard, haha!
